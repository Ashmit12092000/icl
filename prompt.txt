i didn't understand this requirement , due to bad grammer used, i'm giving you the requiremnet please explain ," Need Department Option in Item Master to Filter Items to Show while raising request and to show stock balances based on Department and User Login"

improve the ui of request page and approvals page , stock issue page

Fix the error and also the dashboard page is coming same for all user role . Manager and superadmin should have the section of stock issue request currently there is no any option for manager and superadmin . Remove uneccessary ui elements from the dashboard which have no use and irrelevent

okay so in print request page currently it showing all the details perfectly . I just want one more deatils which is if there is any stock return request then display that information also in the print request page . Display all the information of stock return request mention whether it is partially returned or fully returned and many more info .
